# unity-shader-tests

## Getting Started

This project contains a small set of old and new shader experiments for Unity.

Some were programmed using tutorials, others are simple personal experiments. See Credits

## Basic Materials Example

In this example you can see Ambient Shader, Specular Shading, and Diffuse Shading

### Credits

 * Ambient Light, Difusse Light, Specular Light: This shaders are based on tutorials from digitalerr0r (https://digitalerr0r.wordpress.com)

 * BlurShader: Based on 'cician' shader https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/simple-optimized-blur-shader.185327/#post-1267642 with some improvements and changes
